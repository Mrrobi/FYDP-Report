The revolution from bulk RNA sequencing to single-molecular, single-cell and spatial transcriptome approaches has enabled increasingly accurate, individual cell resolution incorporated with spatial information. Cancer, a major malignant and heterogeneous lethal disease, remains an enormous challenge in medical research and clinical treatment. As a vital tool, RNA sequencing has been utilized in many aspects of cancer research and therapy, including biomarker discovery and characterization of cancer heterogeneity and evolution, drug resistance, cancer immune microenvironment and immunotherapy, cancer neoantigens and so on. In this review, the latest studies on RNA sequencing technology and their applications in cancer are summarized, and future challenges and opportunities for RNA sequencing technology in cancer applications are discussed.},

abstract={The analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data plays an important role in understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular processes in biological and biomedical research. One significant effort in this area is the detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes. scRNAseq data, however, are highly heterogeneous and have a large number of zero counts, which introduces challenges in detecting DE genes. Addressing these challenges requires employing new approaches beyond the conventional ones, which are based on a nonzero difference in average expression. Several methods have been developed for differential gene expression analysis of scRNAseq data. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or developing a new one, it is necessary to evaluate and compare the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods for scRNAseq data.},

Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted of published research articles on diagnostic test accuracy of different machine learning algorithms for breast cancer risk calculation published between January 2000 and May 2018 in the online article databases of PubMed, ProQuest and EBSCO. Paired forest plots were employed for the analysis. Numerical values for sensitivity and specificity were obtained from false negative (FN), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and true positive (TP) rates, presented alongside graphical representations with boxes marking the values and horizontal lines showing the confidence intervals (CIs). Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were applied to assess the performance of diagnostic tests. Data were processed using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3). Results: A total of 1,879 articles were reviewed, of which 11 were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis. Fve algorithms for machine learning able to predict breast cancer risk were identified: Super Vector Machine (SVM); Artificial Neural Networks (ANN); Decision Tree (DT); Naive Bayes (NB); and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). With the SVM, the Area Under Curve (AUC) from the SROC was > 90{\%}, therefore classified into the excellent category. Conclusion: The meta-analysis confirmed that the SVM algorithm is able to calculate breast cancer risk with better accuracy value than other machine learning algorithms.},

The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes."

ABSTRACT = {Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in today&rsquo;s society. The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumours can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognised as the methodology of choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modelling. In this paper, we aim to review ML techniques and their applications in BC diagnosis and prognosis. Firstly, we provide an overview of ML techniques including artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees (DTs), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NNs). Then, we investigate their applications in BC. Our primary data is drawn from the Wisconsin breast cancer database (WBCD) which is the benchmark database for comparing the results through different algorithms. Finally, a healthcare system model of our recent work is also shown.},
